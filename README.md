Notebooks and scripts used for teaching Machine Learning and Data Science in different courses at BSc, MSc and PhD. 

# Scripts4
- **diamond_preprocess.py**: perform some data pre-processing steps, including normalization of the data, imputation, feature selection and creation and data visualization for exploration

- **decision_tree.py**: create a simple decision tree model for a classifier to predict the "cut" of the diamond: "Fair", "Good", "Very Good", "Ideal", "Premium".

- **Auto.ipynb**: notebook to explore the dataset, visualize the data and build simple predictive models to predict origin of the car: european, USA, or Asian.

- **classifier_baseline_pima.**: script to explore the dataset, visualize the data and build two simple predictive models. Note: the PIMA Diabetes dataset is used here. This dataset contains sensitive health data. Although this is a public dataset, its use and analysis should be done taking into account the sensitive nature of this data, keeping in mind that it refers to real people.

- **scaling_pca_hc.py**: script to perform unsupervised learning. Principal Component Analysis with 2 implementations. Clustering: k-means and Hierarchical Clustering. Impact of normalization and scaling of data is tested.



# Data

Note that these datasets are not not my property and have not been generated by me.
These are open-source datasets that are provided here for convenience of reproducibility while running the datasets.

**Please, acknowledge properly the source and authors of this data!**


## Auto
Source: This dataset was taken from the StatLib library which is maintained at Carnegie Mellon University. The dataset was used in the 1983 American Statistical Association Exposition. The original dataset has 397 observations, of which 5 have missing values for the variable "horsepower". These rows are removed here. The original dataset is avaliable as a CSV file in the docs directory, as well as at https://www.statlearning.com.

## Cars93
Details: These cars represent a random sample for 1993 models that were in both Consumer Reports and PACE Buying Guide. Only vehicles of type small, midsize, and large were include.

## Hitters
Details:This dataset was taken from the StatLib library which is maintained at Carnegie Mellon University. This is part of the data that was used in the 1988 ASA Graphics Section Poster Session. The salary data were originally from Sports Illustrated, April 20, 1987. The 1986 and career statistics were obtained from The 1987 Baseball Encyclopedia Update published by Collier Books, Macmillan Publishing Company, New York.
